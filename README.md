# Survey123 data workflows using ArcGIS for Data Interoperability

## Purpose:

This repo is to show no-code solutions built with Data Interoperability for most common patterns of using and managing data collected with Survey123 forms outside the app. <br/>

Survey123 is a very popular app in the ArcGIS Platform. It's easy to deploy and is used to collect data because of its rich features. However, there are user scenarios where collected data needs to be exported to other systems or even for archiving purposes. Thus, it is quite common for data owners to export their survey data and transform the data  according to their business needs. Often, their surveys have attachments and media collected by the field user. <br/>

A code based solution called [Export Task solution using python](https://github.com/Esri/Survey123-tools/blob/main/Export_survey_data_with_attachments/README.md) is also available in another Git repo.  For backup of all feature services, this [How To solution](https://support.esri.com/en-us/knowledge-base/how-to-back-up-hosted-content-by-looping-through-and-do-000022524) using Python would also be valuable references. 


## Use Cases:
1. [Export Survey attachments into Windows folder (fmw)](/Use%20case%201%20-%20Export%20survey%20attachment%20to%20windows%20folder(Workbench)/README.md)<br/>
2. [Export Survey responses and attachment infomation into an Excel report (fmw)](/Use%20case%202%20-%20Export%20survey%20responses%20to%20Excel%20report%20(Workbench)/README.md) <br/>
3. (Backup your Survey123 feature service with attachments]

### Four ways to build Data Interoperability solutions

The solutions that are available in this repo were built using any of the following Data Interop patterns. The feature to be used  depends on the persona of the tool user. The frequency of use would be another consideration. Other considerations include deployment with Pro, Enterprise or even Safe Software's FME Flow. 

* Workbench file (fmw) - most data admin or data owners will build a tool using Data Interoperability's Workbench app, a cloned version of Safe's FME Form product. The authored workbench file (FMW) can be stored in the file system and used without launching Pro, as long as the DI extension license is assigned to the user. A workbench file can also be executed through python or command line for automation and scheduling purposes.

* Spatial ETL Tool (atbx) - this feature is launched from Pro. It starts as a GP tool, and authored from the Workbench app. This feature is best for tools that are frequently run by end users or through Pro's scheduled task.

* Web Tools (GP Service) This feature is a published Spatial ETL tool run from Pro or a browser. Since it's a GP service, its RES end point can be tightly integrated with web apps. This tool is best for end users and inegration with other web solutions. Currently, there are no triggers or scheduling for web tool solutions.

* Quick Tools (GP toolset) This feature is for simple workflows that use the most common ESRI data formats.  There ae two quick tools, one tool for Export and another one for Import.  This feature is very limited in use and capability.


> [!WARNING] 
> Since the FMW file in git appears as a text file, they will always be made available as zipped fmw or fmwt file format.
